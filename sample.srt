00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,502

00:00:00,502 --> 00:00:01,960
DR. WHO: In this
video, we're going

3
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:05,540
to discuss some aspects
of the biology of cancer.

4
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,500
So imagine this epithelial
tissue before you.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,130
There's a single cell that
acquires mutations, possibly

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,470
in genes that
regulate cell growth.

7
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,960
And as these
mutations accumulate,

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,840
the cell starts to proliferate.

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,750
It loses its anchoring
to its surroundings

10
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,990
and starts to
multiply as a tumor.

11
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:29,020
As it grows, it produces
some growth factors

12
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,619
that allow small blood
vessels to invade the tumor

13
00:00:32,619 --> 00:00:34,610
and to provide it
with nutrients.

14
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:37,190
And this process is
called "angiogenesis."

15
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,930


16
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:44,530
As the tumor continues to
grow, sometimes the tumor

17
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,980
will invade surrounding
tissues, or it

18
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:53,330
might be able to cross
into either a blood vessel

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,750
or perhaps into a lymphatic.

20
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:01,120
And by doing so, it can spread,
and this process of spreading

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,510
is known as "metastasis."

22
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,380
So by metastasis
through the blood,

23
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,280
a tumor might
reach other organs.

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,960
So you could have secondaries
of a tumor in the liver,

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,030
or in the kidney, or
the lungs, for instance,

26
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,550
or even in the brain.

27
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:22,670
And sometimes the tumor will
spread through lymphatics

28
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,590
to the draining
lymph node, and one

29
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,500
can see an enlargement
of lymph nodes

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,900
in the vicinity of the tumor.

31
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,620
Now as tumors grow, they are
sustained by many things.

32
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,570


33
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,710
One is you have the sustained
proliferative signaling.

34
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:43,840


35
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,280
You have actually the
absence of cell death,

36
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:49,150
so tumors might shut off
the process of apoptosis.

37
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,030


38
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,880
They may evade
mechanisms of suppressing

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,330
cell growth mediated by genes
known as "tumor suppressors."

40
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,290


41
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:04,460
And these cells also acquire
the ability to metastasize

42
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,750
and have angiogenesis.

43
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:10,800


44
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,410
Now in the old days,
'til about 15 years

45
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,110
ago, the general
view of tumor genesis

46
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,170
was that it involved these
properties that basically

47
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,410
affected the growth of the
cell and its migration,

48
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:26,200
and the immune system was
not brought into the picture.

49
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:29,550
So one goes back and
looks at classical reviews

50
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,090
by Doug Hanahan
and Bob Weinberg.

51
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,350
They describe certain
properties of tumors,

52
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,320
and they call these the six
hallmarks of cancer, which

53
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:40,380
include evasion of
growth suppressors,

54
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,200
the activation of
invasion and metastasis,

55
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,000
the enabling of
replicative immortality,

56
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,370
the induction of angiogenesis,
the resisting of cell death,

57
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,430
and sustaining
proliferative signaling.

58
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,580
But it was recognized, and it
had been recognized before,

59
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:59,040
that sometimes
tumors seem to grow

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,138
in the context of inflammation.

61
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:03,180
And it's also been recognized
that sometimes when

62
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,340
tumors are infiltrated
by immune cells,

63
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,310
they have a better prognosis.

64
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,190
So we do know that tumors are
infiltrated by immune cells,

65
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,980
and that sometimes it is
the inflammatory cells which

66
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,240
provide mutagens and drive
the growth of the tumor

67
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,410
by creating more mutations.

68
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:26,580
So in this situation, you can
think of inflammatory cells

69
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,920
being pro-tumorigenic.

70
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,100
But then there are many other
contexts in which immune cells

71
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,420
come into the tumor.

72
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,623
Sometimes they would have
eliminated the tumor,

73
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:37,290
but we wouldn't have
seen it, and that's

74
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,750
called "immune surveillance."

75
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,850
But on other occasions,
the immune cells

76
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:45,120
are induced to become
exhausted, and effete,

77
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,890
and then the tumor grows.

78
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:51,900
So today, when we think about
the cardinal signs of cancer

79
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,800
we include among these
cardinal features of cancer

80
00:03:55,800 --> 00:04:00,090
a few aspects of the
interaction of the immune system

81
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,200
with the tumor.

82
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,180
So on the one
hand, the tumor has

83
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,600
survived because it has
acquired the ability

84
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,890
to avoid immune destruction.

85
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,530
On the other hand,
sometimes the tumor

86
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:16,579
has grown because immune cells
have created the environment

87
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,149
for the growth of the tumor.

88
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:20,899
So when you think of
the biology of cancer,

89
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,630
we now think of the
biology of cancer

90
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,550
as including aspects
controlling cell growth,

91
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:29,480
angiogenesis,
metastasis, but also we

92
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,990
think about the interplay
between the immune system

93
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:36,050
and the tumor, which could
work in two directions.

94
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,250
The immune system could
have induced the tumor,

95
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,220
but the immune system
also has the power

96
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,360
to help us get rid of the tumor.

97
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,000
